# Custom ShareX Uploader

Hello there,

Note that you need a program similar to ShareX first to use the custom installation tool!

If you follow the steps below correctly, you can simply have a special installation system.

- Fill in the specified areas properly and correctly. (upload.php)
- You will see 2 parts in the settings file. You should write the address of the upload.php file on your site in the url section. Otherwise, the installation process will fail.
- Be sure not to share your secret key with anyone. This can have bad consequences for you. I do not take responsibility..!
- Make sure your all settings are correct and make your first try! Is it successful, congratulations!

-- Oh, no! Did it fail? Do not worry, first grant full authority to your upload.php file from your file manager (777) and try again. If it fails, please open a issue.

### Just a few simple steps ... It's that easy!
